Solution to Lab 0, a lab to check for basic C development skills that
should have been previously gained in the prerequesites for CS 111.

Included files:
  - lab0.c
    This is the main solution; C source code that redirects input and
    output.

  - Makefile
    A makefile that generates the required targets:
      (default) - Builds the lab0 executable
      check - Runs smoke tests (thorough explanation later in this file)
      clean - Deletes files created by the makefile
      dist - Creates a tarball for the lab

  - backtrace.png
    Shows a segfault and associated stacktrace in gdb, as specified

  - breakpoint.png
    Shows a breakpoint and varaible inspection in gdb, as specified

  - README
    This file, explaining everything included in the lab distribution

Smoke tests and Methodology:
  The idea of the smoke tests is to check if the program works as specified.
  Each smoke test is included as a target in the makefile, and works as follows:
    - copy
      Simply pipes the phrase "I love Eggert and Zhaoxing" to stdin, and makes
      sure the same phrase is printed to stdout

      Expected output:
        Copy test exit code CORRECT
        Files input.txt.tmp and output.txt.tmp are identical

    - redirection
      Uses the same phrase, but through the flags --input and --output,
      inspecting the output afterwards

      Expected output:
        Redirection test exit code CORRECT
        Files input.txt.tmp and output.txt.tmp are identical

    - segfault
      Checks to see if a segfault is caused. The exit code is expected to be 139,
      as the default exit code raised when a program segfaults

      Expected output:
        (something indicating a segmentation fault)
        Segfault test exit code CORRECT

    - catch
      Checks to see if the error handling and catching is working; the exit code is
      now expected to be 4, as specified

      Expected output:
        Segmentation fault caught. Exiting...
        Catch test exit code CORRECT

    - dump
      Turns on the catch then dump flag; in this case, it is expected that the order
      is honored, and the program should dump core instead of catching the error. So,
      the expected exit code is 139

      Expected output (approx the same as segfault target):
        (something indicating a segmentation fault)
        Dump test exit code CORRECT


Additional notes:
  For the smoke tests, the lines indicating a segmentation fault in segfault, catch, and dump are
  going to be printed to stderr, not stdout

  The makefile specifies bash as the shell to test for the smoke tests

  The arbitrary filenames input.txt.tmp and output.txt.tmp are used in the copy and redirection targets.
  They are deleted afterwards, so be warned if you currently use files with that name in the same directory.
