Solution to Lab 1b, a lab to build a simple shell called simpsh
For part 1b, everything except --profile has been implemented

Included files:
  - lab1.c
    This is the main solution; C source code that builds the shell
    program

  - Makefile
    A makefile that generates the required targets:
      (default) - Builds the lab1 executable (./simpsh)
      check - Runs smoke tests (thorough explanation later in this file)
      clean - Deletes files created by the makefile
      dist - Creates a tarball for the lab

  - README
    This file, explaining everything included in the lab distribution

Smoke tests and Methodology:
  The idea of the smoke tests is to check if the program works as specified.
  Each smoke test is included as a target in the makefile, and works as follows:
    - tr
      Uses the shell to run the tr command using a file with the phrase
      "I love Eggert and Zhaoxing" as the input and using a file as output

      Verifies the exit code and the contents of the output file

      Expected output:
        tr test exit code CORRECT
        tr test output CORRECT

    - rdfail
      Tells the shell to use a file input.txt.tmp as -rdonly open which should
      fail as the file doesn't exist (rm -f input.txt.tmp).

      Verifies the exit code and that an error message is printed to stderr

      Expected output:
        rdfail test exit code CORRECT
        rdfail test error output CORRECT

    - cmdfail
      Uses an invalid --command input (doesn't have enough fd indicies) which
      should fail

      Verifies the exit code and that an error message is printed to stderr

      Expected output:
        cmdfail test exit code CORRECT
        cmdfail test error output CORRECT

    - verbose
      Tests the --verbose flag by using --rdonly --wronly and --command after it

      Verifies exit code and that the number of lines printed to stdout is 3
      (one for each option)

      Expected output:
        verbose test exit code CORRECT
        verbose test output CORRECT

    - flags
      Tests the file opening flags

      Verifies exit code and the output

      Expected output:
        flags test exit code CORRECT
        flags test output CORRECT

    - pipes
      Tests the --pipe flag

      Verifies exit code and that the pipe succeeded

      Expected output:
        pipes test exit code CORRECT
        pipes test output CORRECT

Additional notes:
  The makefile specifies bash as the shell to test for the smoke tests

  The arbitrary filenames input.txt.tmp, output.txt.tmp, err.txt.tmp, stdout.txt.tmp are used in the check targets
  They are deleted afterwards, so be warned if you currently use files with that name in the same directory.
