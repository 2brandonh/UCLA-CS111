Included files:
  - lab3b.py
    This is the main solution; Python 3 source code that
    investigates a file system csv created by lab3a

  - Makefile
    A makefile that generates the required targets:
      (default) - Builds the lab3b executable (./lab3b)
      clean - Deletes files created by the makefile
      dist - Creates a tarball for the lab

  - README
    This file, explaining everything included in the lab distribution
